A wide range of topics, an exclusive choice of speakers, a day to remember for developers: that's why you should attend this year's DevDay. All talks will be streamed between Faro and Berlin so you won't miss your favorite topic. We're taking care of your wellbeings that day and invite you to extend the box you might be thinking out of.

- The day is massively packed with talks on:
- Large scale machine learning
- Improving Developer UX with CI/CD pipelines
- Enabling modern SPAs using fullstack backends
- What you can do with serverless software
- Next generation programming languages
- Bot logic for semantic releases
- The battle between good code vs. dirty code

or, if you're more into catchy keywords:
React, SPAs, AWS Lambda, Laravel, Kubernetes, Elixir, Redis
